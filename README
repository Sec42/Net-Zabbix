Net::Zabbix is simple and thin layer between Zabbix API and your code. It 
doesn't implement much, except authentication and request counting. There 
are few helper methods to simplify calling methods such as 
create/get/update/delete/exists.

Note:

Module (seems to be) is fully compatible with Zabbix 2.0 and 1.8. But your 
code may not.

Example: 

This will list hosts like '*test*', limited only by access level for API 
user. So, remember to add user to appropriate groups and assign enough 
permissions.

use Net::Zabbix;

my $z = Net::Zabbix->new("http://server/zabbix", "API", "calvin", 1);
my $r = $z->get("host", {
        filter => undef,
        search => {
            host => "test",
        },
    }
);
