One example for thousand words. This one will list unfiltered hostids, 
limited only by access level for API user. So, remember to add user to 
appropriate groups and assign enought permissions.

use lib "./lib/";
use Net::Zabbix;

my $z = Net::Zabbix->new("http://server/zabbix", "API", "calvin", 1);
my $r = $z->get("host", {
		output => "extended",
		filter => undef,
	}
);

Consult Zabbix API documentation for details.
