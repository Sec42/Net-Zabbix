           INFORMATIONS, MALFORMATIONS AND CONFUSIONS IN ZABBIX API

This are things I came across while using Zabbix API, that may be documented 
not as clear as could, or wrong, or not at all.

 * host.delete()

This is is supposed to take list of host ids. 2.0 documentation suggests 
passing an array of ids. It will throw at you an "Wrong fields for host %s" 
exception. 

	"params": [
		"13",
		"32"
	],

But 1.8 docs shows different example:

	"params": [
		{ "hostid": "107824" },
		{ "hostid": "107825" }
	],

And this one is correct. But, so is this one:

	"params": {
		"hostid": "100100000010158",
	},
